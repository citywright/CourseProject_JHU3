# Codebook

This codebook corresponds to the file "summary_output.txt" created by the run_analysis.R
function designed to sort and summarize a dataset obtained from smartphone motion 
sensors. It was developed as the major course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" on
Coursera: www.coursera.com, the third course in the Data Science track from Johns Hopkins
University.  

This codebook was developed by Jonathan Wright.  It is my own work and has been completed
in accordance with the Coursera Honor Code: www.coursera.org/about/terms/honorcode.


### Input Source

The input data for this function is related to Human Activity Recognition of from the
University of California Irvine Machine Learning Respository.  The variable names from
the original dataset have been kept in the summarised dataset for clarity.  A complete
description of the original variables and terminology can be found at:

Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science.

The README.txt file included with the data notes that the values of each variable have
been normalised so that all values are bounded within [-1,1].  This means there are no
units for these variables, as normalising removes units and creates a ratio.
